==============

LuxIRC is intended to be a basic IRC client without too much bloat. It is a self-project of mine to learn the basics of GUI and network programming while making something useful. I will expand the program further by making it scriptable with Lua and Python. I am testing the program in Arch Linux and Windows 10. I will try to get a Mac VM up and running to test in that environment in the near future.

Current Progress:
-----------------
2016/07/25 - Created the Connection class for handling the logic of connecting to networks. Each Connection will connect through its own thread.
2016/04/05 - Started implementing the network side. I want to complete this rather quickly and get basic functionality for my portfolio.
2015/10/23 - I am working on the front-end only and making sure basic file I/O is working properly. I am nearly ready to start delving into the network side of the project.

Libraries and modules used so far:
----------------------------------
Qt 5:
   * QtGui
   * QtCore
