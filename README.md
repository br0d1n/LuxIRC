LuxIRC:
=======
LuxIRC is intended to be a basic IRC client without too much bloat (I hope). It is a self-project of mine to learn the basics of GUI and network programming while making something useful. I am testing and developing the program in Arch Linux only (for now).

Libraries and modules used so far:
----------------------------------
Qt5:
   * QtCore
   * QtGui
   * QtNetwork
   * QtWidgets
