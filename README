==============

LuxIRC is intended to be a basic IRC client without too much bloat. It is a
self-project of mine to learn the basics of GUI and network programming while
making something useful. I will expand the program further by making it
scriptable with Lua and Python. I am testing the program in Arch Linux and
Windows 10. I will try to get a Mac VM up and running to test in that 
environment in the near future.

Current Progress:
-----------------
2015/10/23 - I am working on the front-end only and making sure basic
file I/O is working properly. I am nearly ready to start delving into the
network side of the project.

Libraries and modules used so far:
----------------------------------
Qt 5:
   * QtGui
   * QtCore
