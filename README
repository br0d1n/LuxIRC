==============

LuxIRC is intended to be a basic IRC client without too much bloat. It is a
self-project of mine to learn the basics of GUI and network programming while
making something useful. I will expand the program further by making it
scriptable with Lua and Python.

Libraries and modules used so far:
----------------------------------
Qt 5:
   * QtGui
   * QtCore
